# Purpose üß†
Visually minimalist art therapy application that leverages the power of emotions and colours to facilitate and foster personal expression and well-being. Users can express their emotions through an image and the application will automatically adjust the colour palette and art prompt.

MoodPalette is a concatenation of the words "mood" and "palette", which signify the two main parts of this application. "Mood" comes from the mood detection aspect, while "palette" represents the minimalist art canvas capabilities.

All elements (front-end and back-end) were created by Benjamin Mah.

# Features ü§©
